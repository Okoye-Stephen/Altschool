  <h2 id="biography">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate learner who is eager to gain technical skills and kickstart a career in tech. I decided to
    join AltSchool Africa because of its non-traditional approach to learning, which focuses on teaching courses 
    directly connected to the selected track. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I joined AltSchool Africa because I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in a challenging and 
    supportive environment. I believe continuous learning is crucial, and AltSchool's focus on innovation 
    aligns with my desire to be a valuable tool in the future.

  <h2 id="goals">Goals for School of Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    My goal in the School of Engineering program is to gain a deeper understanding of how technology is built 
    and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I want to learn how to apply my knowledge of language and 
    information processing to contribute to engineering projects. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I hope to develop my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely. This will allow me to 
    collaborate effectively with engineers and other stakeholders to bring innovative solutions to life.
